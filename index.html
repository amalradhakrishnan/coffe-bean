                <p class="p-4 text m-4">A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within  usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to  cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible  increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk in  pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated  by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving  size.</p>

            <h2>TYPES</h2>
            <div>
            <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.</p>
                </div>

                    <li>          
                        <b>Type of bean.</b>
                         There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65 - 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.</li>
                    <li>
                       <b> Type of roast. </b>
                       Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular french roast is medium-dark</li>
                    <li>
                       <b> Type of grind.</b>
                        A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses.</li>
                    <li>
                      <b>  Decaffeinated coffee.</b>
                         This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine.
